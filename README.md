### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Report Generator running on your local machine (Windows).

#### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

1.  **Python:** Version 3.8 or newer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Microsoft Word:** A desktop version of Microsoft Word must be installed on your Windows machine.

#### Installation Instructions

1.  **Get the Code:**
    * **Option A: Clone the Repository:**
        * Go to the GitHub repository page: [https://github.com/TechIT-Community/Report-Generator/](https://github.com/TechIT-Community/Report-Generator/)
        * Click the green `<> Code` button.
        * `üìã`Copy the URL provided under the `Clone` section below `HTTPS`.
        * Open a terminal or command prompt.
        * Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project (e.g., your Desktop).
        * Run the following command:
            ```bash
            git clone <copied URL>
            ```
        * Replace `<copied URL>` with the URL you copied from GitHub.
        * Navigate into the cloned directory:
            ```bash
            cd Report-Generator/app/v1/
            ```
    * **Option B: Download as ZIP:**
        * Go to the GitHub repository page: [https://github.com/TechIT-Community/Report-Generator/](https://github.com/TechIT-Community/Report-Generator/)
        * Click the green `<> Code` button.
        * Click `Download ZIP`.
        * Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice (e.g., your Desktop).
        * After extraction, navigate into the extracted folder. 
            - Either open the folder in an IDE &nbsp;&nbsp; *(OR)* 
            - Enter "cmd" into the address bar of the File Explorer and press Enter to open a command prompt in that directory(inside app/v1/).

2.  **Verify Project Structure:**
    After extracting, your project folder should already have the necessary files and folders. It will look like this:

    ```bash
    Report-Generator/app/v1/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BNMIT_Logo.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BNMIT_Text.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.ico
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VTU_Logo.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document_Generator.py   #Driver code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.py                 #Frontend GUI
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
        ```bash
        cd <save location>
        ```
        Replace `<save location>` with the path where you cloned or extracted the project.
        Usually `cd Desktop/Report-Generator/app/v1/` if you cloned it to your Desktop.
    * It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (`venv`) to keep project dependencies isolated.

    * **Option A: Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
        * Create the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal in the project directory:
            <a id="venv-setup"></a>
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv
            ```
        * Activate it:
            ```bash
            # On Windows
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        * Install the required libraries:
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```

    * **Option B: Install Globally**
        * If you prefer not to use a virtual environment, you can install the packages directly by running the following command in your terminal in the project directory:
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application with a single command:

1.  Make sure you are still in the project directory in your terminal. (If you used a venv, [ensure it is active](#venv-setup)).
2.  Run the `Main.py` script:
    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```
3.  The application window and a new Microsoft Word document should appear on your screen.
4.  Follow the these instructions to fill in your project details, chapters, and images.
    -   Please ensure that Microsoft Word is closed before running the application to avoid any conflicts.
    -   Please wait for the Word document to open completely and render a template before interacting with the application.
    -   Enter your project details in the first page.
    -   Click `Next` to navigate through the pages.
    -   Click `Previous` to go back if needed.
    -   Use the `Add Image` button to upload images for each chapter.
    -   Click `Done` to Generate your final document.
5.  After you click `Done`, the application will automatically generate a Microsoft Word document with your report, including all the chapters and images you provided. The generated report will be saved in the `reports/` folder 
6.  You can open the generated report in Microsoft Word to review and make any final adjustments as needed.

### üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The project is built with a clean separation of concerns:

* **`Main.py` (The Frontend):** This script handles the entire user interface. It creates the windows, fields, and buttons. When you click "Next", it saves your input and sends it to the backend.
* **`Document_Generator.py` (The Backend):** This script is the engine. It uses the `pywin32` library to control Microsoft Word. It first creates a template with static text and placeholders (called "bookmarks"). When it receives data from the frontend, it finds the corresponding bookmarks and fills them with your text and images.
