Basic App â

First of all, make sure you got the latest version of CustomTkinter installed. Then you can test your installation with the most basic program, which only creates a window:


```

import customtkinterapp = customtkinter.CTk()app.mainloop()

```

If this is working, you can start setting properties of the window like title and geometry , and start adding a button to the window.
The first parameter to any widget is always the master parameter, which is app in this case. It can also be given with a keyword argument ( master=app ).


```

import customtkinterdef button_callback():    print("button pressed")app = customtkinter.CTk()app.title("my app")app.geometry("400x150")button = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, text="my button", command=button_callback)button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20)app.mainloop()

```

Grid geometry manager â

In this example the grid geometry manager is used to set the position and padding of the widget. It is highly recommended to always use the grid geometry manager instead of place and pack , because it is very easy to create responsive and extendable user interfaces.

The grid splits a window or frame into columns and rows, which collapse when they are empty, but adapt to the size of the widgets placed inside them. If you want to center the button in the last example, you would have to give the first column a weight other than zero, so that it does not collapse to the size of the button anymore (use grid_rowconfigure() for rows):


```

app.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)

```

Now column 0 spans the whole window because it has a weight of 1 and therefore expands. You can also configure the button to expand with it's grid cell if you add a sticky argument to the grid call like this:


```

button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20, sticky="ew")

```

Now the button sticks to the grid cell on the east and west side. You can notice that grid cell and therefore the button size adapts if you resize the window.

Add checkboxes â

To get make the layout a bit more complex, we add two checkboxes in the second row.


```

checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(app, text="checkbox 1")checkbox_1.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(app, text="checkbox 2")checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")

```

Note that the pady argument gets a tuple, which means 0 padding on the top and 20 padding on the bottom. Also note that the checkboxes are only sticky to the west side of their grid cell.
To let the button span the whole window again, we need to set a columnspan of 2 for it (use rowspan for rows).


```

button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)

```

And to equally space the checkboxes we also need to give both columns an equal weight.


```

app.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1), weight=1)

```

The the complete program looks like this now:


```

def button_callback():    print("button pressed")app = customtkinter.CTk()app.title("my app")app.geometry("400x150")app.grid_columnconfigure((0), weight=1)button = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, text="my button", command=button_callback)button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(app, text="checkbox 1")checkbox_1.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(app, text="checkbox 2")checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")app.mainloop()

```

Using classes â

To complete this introduction, we want to structure this program into a class. It is highly recommended to use classes which inherit from CTk for the main window or CTkFrame for a frame, because it highly increases the readability of the code and the code becomes easily extendable, because classes can be easily distributed to multiple files.

Except for small programs or tests, always create separate classes for CTk , CTkToplevel or CTkFrame . Writing a lot of UI code in a single file without using classes is a pain to read and very bad coding style.


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x150")        self.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1), weight=1)        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=20, pady=(0, 20), sticky="w")            def button_callback(self):        print("button pressed")app = App()app.mainloop()

Creating a frame â

We start with a similar example than in the intro, a window with a button and some checkboxes:


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x180")        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure((0, 1), weight=1)        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew")    def button_callback(self):        print("button pressed")app = App()app.mainloop()

```

If we now want to add another checkbox in row 2, we would also have to change the row number of the button. So a change like this requires changes on the layout below the checkbox. To prevent such side effects, keep changes contained and structure the layout visually, we are using frames.

We place the frame in to row 0, the button in row 1, and configure row 0 and column 0 to expand. The frame gets a sticky parameter of 'nsw' so it expands with its cell to the north, south and west. The checkboxes now get the frame as the master argument instead of self .


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x180")        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.checkbox_frame = customtkinter.CTkFrame(self)        self.checkbox_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsw")        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self.checkbox_frame, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self.checkbox_frame, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew")    def button_callback(self):        print("button pressed")

```

Using classes â

And to reflect the layout in the code and follow the priniciple of always using classes from the intro, we will move the frame and checkbox code into a separate class. This class inherits from CTkFrame and an instance of this class gets created in the main App class.
Only the master argument needs to get passed into the __init__ method of the new MyCheckboxFrame and so that it can then get passed to the __init__ of the super class which is the CTkFrame .


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master):        super().__init__(master)        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x180")        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.checkbox_frame = MyCheckboxFrame(self)        self.checkbox_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsw")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew")    def button_callback(self):        print("button pressed")app = App()app.mainloop()

```

Now we can simply add another checkbox in the MyCheckboxFrame class without affecting the layout of the button:


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master):        super().__init__(master)        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_3 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 3")        self.checkbox_3.grid(row=2, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")

```

Extend frame class â

Of course we need a way to read the values of the checkboxes from the main App class. Therefore we will implement a get method for the MyCheckboxFrame class, which will return a list of strings with the text attributes of the checked checkboxes:


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master):        super().__init__(master)        self.checkbox_1 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 1")        self.checkbox_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_2 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 2")        self.checkbox_2.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")        self.checkbox_3 = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text="checkbox 3")        self.checkbox_3.grid(row=2, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            def get(self):        checked_checkboxes = []        if self.checkbox_1.get() == 1:            checked_checkboxes.append(self.checkbox_1.cget("text"))        if self.checkbox_2.get() == 1:            checked_checkboxes.append(self.checkbox_2.cget("text"))        if self.checkbox_3.get() == 1:            checked_checkboxes.append(self.checkbox_3.cget("text"))        return checked_checkboxes

```

We can use this method in the button_callback method of the App class:


```

    def button_callback(self):        print("checked checkboxes:", self.checkbox_frame.get())

```

Now if you press the button, the currently checked checkboxes will be printed:


```

checked checkboxes: ['checkbox 1', 'checkbox 3']

```

Dynamic frame class â

But the values of the checkboxes in the MyCheckboxFrame are hardcoded in the code right now. To make the MyCheckboxFrame class more dynamically usable, we pass a list of string values to the MyCheckboxFrame , which will be the text values of the checkboxes in the frame. Now the number of checkboxes is also arbitrary.


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master, values):        super().__init__(master)        self.values = values        self.checkboxes = []        for i, value in enumerate(self.values):            checkbox = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text=value)            checkbox.grid(row=i, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            self.checkboxes.append(checkbox)    def get(self):        checked_checkboxes = []        for checkbox in self.checkboxes:            if checkbox.get() == 1:                checked_checkboxes.append(checkbox.cget("text"))        return checked_checkboxes

```

The checkboxes get created in a for loop and saved in a list called checkboxes . In the get method we can loop through this list to check which checkbox is checked and return the appropriate text values. In the App class, where we create an instance of the MyCheckboxFrame , we need to pass a list of values now:


```

self.checkbox_frame = MyCheckboxFrame(self, values=["value 1", "value 2", "value 3"])self.checkbox_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsw")

```

Multiple instances â

But now that we can dynamically control the values of checkboxes, we can very easily create two or more instances of the MyCheckboxFrame class. We have to give the button a columnspan of 2 and add a weight of 1 to column 1.


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x180")        self.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1), weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.checkbox_frame_1 = MyCheckboxFrame(self, values=["value 1", "value 2", "value 3"])        self.checkbox_frame_1.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsew")        self.checkbox_frame_2 = MyCheckboxFrame(self, values=["option 1", "option 2"])        self.checkbox_frame_2.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=(0, 10), pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsew")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)    def button_callback(self):        print("checkbox_frame_1:", self.checkbox_frame_1.get())        print("checkbox_frame_2:", self.checkbox_frame_2.get())

```

Output when the button gets pressed:


```

checkbox_frame_1: ['value 1', 'value 3']checkbox_frame_2: ['option 2']

```

Add title to frame â

We can further enhance the MyCheckboxFrame class by adding label, which acts as a title for the frame.


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master, title, values):        super().__init__(master)        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.values = values        self.title = title        self.checkboxes = []        self.title = customtkinter.CTkLabel(self, text=self.title, fg_color="gray30", corner_radius=6)        self.title.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="ew")        for i, value in enumerate(self.values):            checkbox = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text=value)            checkbox.grid(row=i+1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            self.checkboxes.append(checkbox)    def get(self):        checked_checkboxes = []        for checkbox in self.checkboxes:            if checkbox.get() == 1:                checked_checkboxes.append(checkbox.cget("text"))        return checked_checkboxes

```

Note that column 0 inside of the frame is now configure to have a weight of 1, so that the label spans the whole frame with its sticky value of 'ew'. For the CTkLabel we passed an fg_color and corner_radius argument because the label is 'transparent' by default and has a corner_radius of 0. ALso note that the grid row position is now i+1 because of the title label in the first row.

Now we need to pass values for the title parameter of the MyCheckboxFrame when we create instances of it in the App class:


```

self.checkbox_frame_1 = MyCheckboxFrame(self, "Values", values=["value 1", "value 2", "value 3"])

```


```

self.checkbox_frame_2 = MyCheckboxFrame(self, "Options", values=["option 1", "option 2"])

```

If we also increase the height of the window to 220px we get:

Now we have titles for the checkbox frames. And because MyCheckboxFrame inherits from CTkFrame , it can be configured like a CTkFrame , for example with a transparent fg_color :


```

self.checkbox_frame_2.configure(fg_color="transparent")

```

Radiobutton frame â

Similar to the MyCheckboxFrame we can create a MyRadiobuttonFrame which consists of radiobuttons instead of checkboxes.


```

class MyRadiobuttonFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master, title, values):        super().__init__(master)        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.values = values        self.title = title        self.radiobuttons = []        self.variable = customtkinter.StringVar(value="")        self.title = customtkinter.CTkLabel(self, text=self.title, fg_color="gray30", corner_radius=6)        self.title.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="ew")        for i, value in enumerate(self.values):            radiobutton = customtkinter.CTkRadioButton(self, text=value, value=value, variable=self.variable)            radiobutton.grid(row=i + 1, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            self.radiobuttons.append(radiobutton)    def get(self):        return self.variable.get()    def set(self, value):        self.variable.set(value)

```

And in the App we create an instance of MyRadiobuttonFrame similar to MyCheckboxFrame :


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x220")        self.grid_columnconfigure((0, 1), weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.checkbox_frame = MyCheckboxFrame(self, "Values", values=["value 1", "value 2", "value 3"])        self.checkbox_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsew")        self.radiobutton_frame = MyRadiobuttonFrame(self, "Options", values=["option 1", "option 2"])        self.radiobutton_frame.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=(0, 10), pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsew")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)    def button_callback(self):        print("checkbox_frame:", self.checkbox_frame.get())        print("radiobutton_frame:", self.radiobutton_frame.get())

```

Now we have two different dynamically created frames, that can be used to get input from the user.

Checkboxes on frame â

In the chapter before we created the following frame, which creates checkboxes for a given list of values:


```

class MyCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, master, values):        super().__init__(master)        self.values = values        self.checkboxes = []        for i, value in enumerate(self.values):            checkbox = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text=value)            checkbox.grid(row=i, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            self.checkboxes.append(checkbox)    def get(self):        checked_checkboxes = []        for checkbox in self.checkboxes:            if checkbox.get() == 1:                checked_checkboxes.append(checkbox.cget("text"))        return checked_checkboxes

```

Scrollable frame â

If you want to display more checkboxes than there is space in the layout or on the screen, then you can use a scrollable frame. The CTkScrollableFrame automatically add's a scrollbar so you can add more widgets than actually fit inside the frame. The frame will not expand with the widgets in it. The CTkScrollableFrame also comes with an option for a title, with the label_text argument you can pass text for a title label like we created manually in the above example.


```

class MyScrollableCheckboxFrame(customtkinter.CTkScrollableFrame):    def __init__(self, master, title, values):        super().__init__(master, label_text=title)        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.values = values        self.checkboxes = []        for i, value in enumerate(self.values):            checkbox = customtkinter.CTkCheckBox(self, text=value)            checkbox.grid(row=i, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="w")            self.checkboxes.append(checkbox)    def get(self):        checked_checkboxes = []        for checkbox in self.checkboxes:            if checkbox.get() == 1:                checked_checkboxes.append(checkbox.cget("text"))        return checked_checkboxes

```

Now we can create an instance of MyScrollableCheckboxFrame in the App class and add more values to test the scrollbar functionality:


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.title("my app")        self.geometry("400x220")        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)        values = ["value 1", "value 2", "value 3", "value 4", "value 5", "value 6"]        self.scrollable_checkbox_frame = MyScrollableCheckboxFrame(self, title="Values", values=values)        self.scrollable_checkbox_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=(10, 0), sticky="nsew")        self.button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="my button", command=self.button_callback)        self.button.grid(row=3, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew", columnspan=2)    def button_callback(self):        print("checkbox_frame:", self.checkbox_frame.get())        print("radiobutton_frame:", self.radiobutton_frame.get())app = App()app.mainloop()

```

Create widgets from frame â

If you want to create new widgets by yourself, because you need something that's not implemented with Customtkinter, you can easily do this. In the following I created a Spinbox based on float values.

First you create a new class, that inherits from customtkinter.CTkFrame :


```

import customtkinterclass WidgetName(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, *args,                 width: int = 100,                 height: int = 32,                 **kwargs):        super().__init__(*args, width=width, height=height, **kwargs)

```

By doing this, you already have a widget that has a default size given by the default values of the attributes width and height. And it also supports all attributes of a CTkFrame like fg_color and corner_radius.

Create spinbox from frame â

A simple implementation af a float based Spinbox could look like the following:


```

class FloatSpinbox(customtkinter.CTkFrame):    def __init__(self, *args,                 width: int = 100,                 height: int = 32,                 step_size: Union[int, float] = 1,                 command: Callable = None,                 **kwargs):        super().__init__(*args, width=width, height=height, **kwargs)        self.step_size = step_size        self.command = command        self.configure(fg_color=("gray78", "gray28"))  # set frame color        self.grid_columnconfigure((0, 2), weight=0)  # buttons don't expand        self.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1)  # entry expands        self.subtract_button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="-", width=height-6, height=height-6,                                                       command=self.subtract_button_callback)        self.subtract_button.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=(3, 0), pady=3)        self.entry = customtkinter.CTkEntry(self, width=width-(2*height), height=height-6, border_width=0)        self.entry.grid(row=0, column=1, columnspan=1, padx=3, pady=3, sticky="ew")        self.add_button = customtkinter.CTkButton(self, text="+", width=height-6, height=height-6,                                                  command=self.add_button_callback)        self.add_button.grid(row=0, column=2, padx=(0, 3), pady=3)        # default value        self.entry.insert(0, "0.0")    def add_button_callback(self):        if self.command is not None:            self.command()        try:            value = float(self.entry.get()) + self.step_size            self.entry.delete(0, "end")            self.entry.insert(0, value)        except ValueError:            return    def subtract_button_callback(self):        if self.command is not None:            self.command()        try:            value = float(self.entry.get()) - self.step_size            self.entry.delete(0, "end")            self.entry.insert(0, value)        except ValueError:            return    def get(self) -> Union[float, None]:        try:            return float(self.entry.get())        except ValueError:            return None    def set(self, value: float):        self.entry.delete(0, "end")        self.entry.insert(0, str(float(value)))

```

Of course you could add a configure method or more attributes to configure the colors in the init method.

But with the above implementation you can use the spin box like the following:


```

app = customtkinter.CTk()spinbox_1 = FloatSpinbox(app, width=150, step_size=3)spinbox_1.pack(padx=20, pady=20)spinbox_1.set(35)print(spinbox_1.get())app.mainloop()

```

Color and Themes

Color â

All colors of the widgets can be customised, the appropriate arguments can be found in the documentation of the specific widgets. Note that bg_color is only the color behind the widget if it has rounded corners. The main color of a widget is called fg_color:

The colors can either be set to a single color name ( "red" ), a single hex color string ( "#FF0000" ) or a tuple color for a light mode color and dark mode color ( ("red", "darkred") ). The current color will then be picked by the widget automatically according to the current appearance mode . So by using the tuple color, the widgets can have different colors in light and dark appearance mode. If you use a single color then this color will be used for both light and dark appearance mode.

Example:


```

button = customtkinter.CTkButton(root_tk, fg_color="red")  # single color namebutton = customtkinter.CTkButton(root_tk, fg_color="#FF0000")  # single hex stringbutton = customtkinter.CTkButton(root_tk, fg_color=("#DB3E39", "#821D1A"))  # tuple color

```

Themes â

By default all colours are set by the color theme. Currently there a three themes available: "blue" , "dark-blue" and "green" , where "blue" is the standard theme. All themes provide tuple colors for a light and dark appearance mode .

You can set the theme at the beginning of your programming like the following:


```

customtkinter.set_default_color_theme("dark-blue")  # Themes: "blue" (standard), "green", "dark-blue"

```

Custom Themes â

A theme is described by a .json file like this: dark-blue.json .
You can also create your own theme, so that you don't have to set the styling for every widget manually. Just copy the .json file above and change the values. Then you can load the new theme by passing the path to your .json file to the .set_default_color_theme method:


```

customtkinter.set_default_color_theme("path/to/your/custom_theme.json")

```

Appearance Mode

The appearance mode decides, which color will be picked from tuple colors, if the color is specified as a tuple color.
You can set the appearance mode at any time with the following command:


```

customtkinter.set_appearance_mode("system")  # defaultcustomtkinter.set_appearance_mode("dark")customtkinter.set_appearance_mode("light")

```

If you set the appearance mode to "system" , the current mode is read from the operating system. It will also adapt if the appearance mode of the operating system changes during the runtime of the program. Note that on Linux it will be always in "light" mode if set to "system" , because the mode can't get read from the operating system at the moment, this will probably be implemented in the future.

HighDPI support â

CustomTkinter supports HighDPI scaling on macOS and Windows by default. On macOS scaling works automatically for Tk windows. On Windows, the app is made DPI aware ( windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(2) ) and the current scaling factor of the display is detected. Then every element and the window dimensions are scaled by this factor by CustomTkinter.

You can deactivate this automatic scaling like this:


```

customtkinter.deactivate_automatic_dpi_awareness()

```

Then the window will be blurry on Windows with a scaling value of more than 100%.

Custom scaling â

In addition to the automatically detected scaling factor, you can also set your own scaling factors for the application like the following:


```

customtkinter.set_widget_scaling(float_value)  # widget dimensions and text sizecustomtkinter.set_window_scaling(float_value)  # window geometry dimensions

```

Windows PyInstaller (Auto Py to Exe) â

When you create a .exe on Windows with pyinstaller, there are two things you have to consider.
Firstly, you cannot use the --onefile option of pyinstaller, because the customtkinter library includes not only .py files, but also data files like .json and .otf. PyInstaller is not able to pack them into a single .exe file, so you have to use the --onedir option.

And secondly, you have to include the customtkinter directory manually with the --add-data option of pyinstaller. Because for some reason, pyinstaller doesn't automatically include datafiles like .json from the library.
You can find the install location of the customtkinter library with the following command:


```

pip show customtkinter

```

A Location will be shown, for example: c:\users\<user_name>\appdata\local\programs\python\python310\lib\site-packages

Then add the library folder like this: --add-data "C:/Users/<user_name>/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/Lib/site-packages/customtkinter;customtkinter/"

With Auto Py to Exe you would do it like this:

For the full command you get something like this:


```

pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --add-data "<CustomTkinter Location>/customtkinter;customtkinter/"  "<Path to Python Script>"

```

CTkTabview

The CTkTabview creates a tabview, similar to a notebook in tkinter. The tabs, which are created with .add("<tab-name>") are CTkFrames and can be used like CTkFrames. Any widgets can be placed on them.

Example Code â

Example without using classes:


```

tabview = customtkinter.CTkTabview(master=app)tabview.pack(padx=20, pady=20)tabview.add("tab 1")  # add tab at the endtabview.add("tab 2")  # add tab at the endtabview.set("tab 2")  # set currently visible tabbutton = customtkinter.CTkButton(master=tabview.tab("tab 1"))button.pack(padx=20, pady=20)

```

It's also possible to save tabs in extra variables:


```

tab_1 = tabview.add("tab 1")tab_2 = tabview.add("tab 2")button = customtkinter.CTkButton(tab_1)

```

Example with classes:


```

class MyTabView(customtkinter.CTkTabview):    def __init__(self, master, **kwargs):        super().__init__(master, **kwargs)        # create tabs        self.add("tab 1")        self.add("tab 2")        # add widgets on tabs        self.label = customtkinter.CTkLabel(master=self.tab("tab 1"))        self.label.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=10)class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.tab_view = MyTabView(master=self)        self.tab_view.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=20, pady=20)app = App()app.mainloop()

CTkTextbox

The CTkTextbox class creates a textbox, which is scrollable in vertical and horizontal direction (with wrap='none' ). The insert , get and delete methods are based on tkinter indices, which are explained here: https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/text-index.html

Example Code â

Example without using classes:


```

textbox = customtkinter.CTkTextbox(app)textbox.insert("0.0", "new text to insert")  # insert at line 0 character 0text = textbox.get("0.0", "end")  # get text from line 0 character 0 till the endtextbox.delete("0.0", "end")  # delete all texttextbox.configure(state="disabled")  # configure textbox to be read-only

```

Example with classes, where the textbox completely fills the window:


```

class App(customtkinter.CTk):    def __init__(self):        super().__init__()        self.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)  # configure grid system        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)        self.textbox = customtkinter.CTkTextbox(master=self, width=400, corner_radius=0)        self.textbox.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="nsew")        self.textbox.insert("0.0", "Some example text!\n" * 50)app = App()app.mainloop()

Documentation of CustomTkinter utility classes like CTkFont and CTkImage.

ðï¸ CTkFont

There are two methods in CustomTkinter to set a font. The first one is by creating a tuple of the form:

ðï¸ CTkImage

The CTkImage is not a widget itself, but a container for up to two PIL Image objects for light and dark mode. There's also a size tuple which describes the width and height of the image independent of scaling. Therefore it's important that the PIL Image's are in a higher resolution than the given size tuple, so that the image is not blurry if rendered on a 4K monitor with 2x scaling. So that the image is displayed in sharp resolution on a 2x scaled monitor, the given OIL Image's must have at least double the resolution than the requested size.

CTkFont

There are two methods in CustomTkinter to set a font. The first one is by creating a tuple of the form:


```

button = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, font=("<family name>", <size in px>, "<optional keywords>"))

```

This font can not be configured afterwards. The optional keywords can be normal/bold, roman/italic, underline and overstrike.

The better way is to create a CTkFont object, which can be modified afterwards and can be used for multiple widgets:


```

button = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, font=customtkinter.CTkFont(family="<family name>", size=<size in px>, <optional keyword arguments>))button.cget("font").configure(size=new_size)  # configure font afterwards

```

All widgets get a CTkFont object by default, so configuring the font of a widget is possible by default.

A font object can also be applied to multiple widgets, and if it gets configured, the changes get passed to all widgets using this font:


```

my_font = customtkinter.CTkFont(family="<family name>", size=<size in px>, <optional keyword arguments>)button_1 = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, font=my_font)button_2 = customtkinter.CTkButton(app, font=my_font)my_font.configure(family="new name")  # changes apply to button_1 and button_2

```

Metrics include: ascent: Number of pixels of height between the baseline and the top of the highest ascender. descent: Number of pixels of height between the baseline and the bottom of the lowest ascender. fixed: This value isÂ 0Â for a variable-width font andÂ 1Â for a monospaced font. linespace: Number of pixels of height total. This is the leading of type set solid in the given font.

CTkImage

The CTkImage is not a widget itself, but a container for up to two PIL Image objects for light and dark mode. There's also a size tuple which describes the width and height of the image independent of scaling. Therefore it's important that the PIL Image's are in a higher resolution than the given size tuple, so that the image is not blurry if rendered on a 4K monitor with 2x scaling. So that the image is displayed in sharp resolution on a 2x scaled monitor, the given OIL Image's must have at least double the resolution than the requested size.

Create a CTkImage object:


```

from PIL import Imagemy_image = customtkinter.CTkImage(light_image=Image.open("<path to light mode image>"),                                  dark_image=Image.open("<path to dark mode image>"),                                  size=(30, 30))image_label = customtkinter.CTkLabel(app, image=my_image, text="")  # display image with a CTkLabel

```

Arguments â

If only light_image or only dark_image is given, the existing one will be used for both light and dark mode.
